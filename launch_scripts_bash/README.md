/launch_scripts_bash

Contains shell-launch scripts. Shell-launch scripts can be used
 when the intention is to launch Gazebo Simulator, AUV modules,
 and a Finite State Machine (FSM) simultaneously.
 It spares a bit of time in case of repeated launches,
 and requires only a single terminal to launch everything.
